                    Each of these modules involved working in groups of 4-8 to write Python programs capable of
                    analysing astronomical datasets and thus allowing research to be conducted. It was in these modules
                    that I discovered my passion for working with data and the satisfaction of producing results after
                    designing analysing programs. These modules also allowed me to vastly improve my Python programming
                    skills by allowing me to put my previous knowledge into practice, and forcing me to learn when my
                    existing knowledge was insufficient. After completing these modules, I am now particularly confident
                    with NumPy, MatPlotLib and Pandas.

                    My grades throughout my degree have been very strong so far. In the first three years of my
                    integrated masters, I have achieved a first in 27/30 modules. Of particular note is the
                    Observational Astronomy module, in which a received a moderated grade of 100/100.

                <p>
                    I achieved outstanding grades during secondary school, achieving the maximum grade in 10/13
                    subjects throughout GCSE and A-Level. One such grade is a 9 in GCSE English Language, highlighting
                    a strength which can be applied to written reports and oral presentations. This is further evidenced
                    by my achieving a first in all presentations, essays and reports in my degree, as well as the
                    Physics Critique module.
