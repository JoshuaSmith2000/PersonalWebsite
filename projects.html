            <h2>Tracking Down the Brightest Galaxies in the Universe</h2>
            <h3>Summer Research Project, University of Birmingham (06/2021 - 08/2021)</h3>

                    After achieving the highest grade out of a group of students that worked on a preliminary form of this
                    project, I was chosen to complete it over the summer. The project involved identifying the brightest galaxy
                    of each of the 306 galaxy clusters from an astronomical dataset. I achieved this by creating a Python
                    program that used NumPy for mathematical operations and MatPlotLib for producing plots. I used two datasets:
                    one that contained data about the clusters (most importantly their coordinates), and another that held data
                    for each light source (i.e stars and galaxies) in the sky. Hence, I was able to create a shortlist of light
                    sources within a certain radius of each cluster's coordinates, and then use scientific models to separate
                    the stars from the galaxies. At this point, it was possible to identify the brightest galaxy in each case.
                    Plots were produced for each cluster to confirm that the results being produced were reasonable. Upon
                    completing the project, I produced a dataset containing data for each of these brightest galaxies. I am also
                    first author on a short paper for the project, which is due to be published in early October. I was aided by
                    a professor and a PhD student throughout the project, and so I was able to learn how to efficiently learn
                    complex ideas from more knowledgeable colleagues, as well as how to effectively express my own ideas.
